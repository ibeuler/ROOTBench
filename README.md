# Compare Frameworks

This repository compares different analysis frameworks in High Energy Physics (HEP):
- ROOT (C++)
- PyROOT (Python)
- CutLang (ADL)

Using data from ATLAS Open Data, the study implements identical analyses across these frameworks to evaluate:
- Syntax complexity
- Implementation approaches
- Development speed
- Resource availability

Key findings:
- ROOT/PyROOT offer extensive documentation but complex setup
- CutLang provides simpler syntax, also complex setup
- All frameworks produce comparable analysis results
