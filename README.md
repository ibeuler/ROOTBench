# Compare Frameworks

This repository compares different analysis frameworks in High Energy Physics (HEP):
- ROOT (C++)
- PyROOT (Python)
- CutLang (ADL)

Using data from ATLAS Open Data, the study implements identical analyses across these frameworks to evaluate:
- Syntax complexity
- Implementation approaches
- Development speed
- Resource availability

Key findings:
- ROOT/PyROOT offer extensive documentation but complex setup
- CutLang provides simpler syntax with growing community support
- All frameworks produce comparable analysis results

### Aknowledgments
I would like to acknowledge the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub Copilot in assisting with the search, study, and writing of this report. These tools provided valuable support in generating content and improving the overall quality of the report.
